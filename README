## Overview
Some practical implementations of popular machine learning algorithms.
Data is partially taken from the LIBSVM data sets[1].

### Usage
Running the demo file is easy:
$ python demo.py
This should do it. Make sure NumPy is installed and added to your PYTHONPATH. To check this, type
$ python
and in the Python shell
>> import numpy
if no error occurs, NumPy is installed correctly.

### Currently implemented
* Ridge Regression

### TODO
* fine tuning Ridge Regression
* output validation R.R.
* logistic regression
* SVMs (SMO +variants)
* make test suite
