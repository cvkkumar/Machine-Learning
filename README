## Overview
Some implementations of popular machine learning algorithms.
Data is partially taken from the LIBSVM data sets[1].

### Usage
Running the demo file is easy:

    $ ./demo_example_data_classification.sh
    
This should do it. Make sure NumPy is installed and added to your PYTHONPATH. To check this, type

    $ python
    
and in the Python shell

    >> import numpy
    
if no error occurs, NumPy is installed correctly.

### Currently implemented
* Regression
** Ridge Regression
* Classification
** SVM (dual coordinate descent)
** SVM (SMO - Keerthi et. al., 2001)
* Kernels
** linear
** polynomial
** radial basis function
